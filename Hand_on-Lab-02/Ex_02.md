# Exercise 2: Enable Managed SNAT for Azure VMware Solution workloads 

A SNAT service translates from an RFC 1918 space to the public internet for simple outbound internet access. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is turned off by design so that users can't ping an internet host. The SNAT service doesn't work when you have a default route from Azure.

The Managed SNAT service in Azure VMware Solution gives you:

A basic SNAT service with outbound internet connectivity from your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
A limit of 128,000 concurrent connections.
By using the Managed SNAT service, you don't have:

Control of outbound SNAT rules.
Control of the public IP address that's used.
The ability to terminate inbound-initiated internet traffic.
The ability to view connection logs.
