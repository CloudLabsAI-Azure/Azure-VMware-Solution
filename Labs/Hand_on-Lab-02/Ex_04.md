# Exercise 4: Deploy VMware VMs in AVS 

### Create Test VMs
Now that we have our networks created, we can deploy virtual machines and ensure we can get an IP address from DHCP. Go ahead and log in to your AVS vCenter.

## Lab objectives

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a Content Library
+ Task 2: Import Item to Content Library 
+ Task 3: Create VMs
+ Task 4: Connect to the VMs

### Task 1: Create a Content Library

1. Navigate back to the **Azure portal** where the **Azure VMware Solution page** is open.

3. On the Azure VMware Solution page; click on **VMware credentials (1)** under Manage tab and then copy the **Web client URL**, **Username** and **Password** under vCenter Server Credentials **(2)** and save it in notepad for later use.
