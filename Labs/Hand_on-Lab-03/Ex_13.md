4. After the services restart, you’ll see vCenter showing as Green on the screen that appears. Both vCenter and SSO must have the appropriate configuration parameters, which should be the same as the previous screen.

> **Note**: Please note that by default HCX assigns the HCX administrator role to “vsphere.local\Administrators”. In real life, customers will have a different SSO domain than vsphere.local and need to be changed. This is the case for this lab and this needs to be changed to avs.lab.
> 
> **Note**: It may take an additional 5-10 minutes for the HCX plugins to be installed in vCenter, log back out, and log back in if it does not show up automatically.
