## Exercise 2: Deploy VMware VMs in AVS 

### Create Test VMs
Now that we have our networks created, we can deploy virtual machines and ensure we can get an IP address from DHCP. Go ahead and Login into your AVS vCenter.

## Lab objectives

In this Exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a Content Library
+ Task 2: Import Item to Content Library 
+ Task 3: Create VMs
+ Task 4: Connect to the VMs

### Task 1: Create a Content Library

1. Under Resource groups tab, launch **AVS-RG**.

### Task 4: Connect to the VMs

In this task you will be connecting to the VMs using **Putty (SSH Tool)**, which is already installed in the **JumpBox** which is already connected with lab environment.

   > **Important:** Ensure both the test VMs are turned on before performing this task.

1. From the **JumpBox**, from start menu search `Putty` **(1)** and then click on **Putty (2)**

   ![](../Images/search-putty-startmenu.jpg)
   
2. Enter the Private-IP of **TestVM-1** VM in Host Name in putty tool and then click on **Open (2)**.
   * Host Name (or IP address): `10.10.4.4`
    
     ![](../Images/enter-testvm1-ip.jpg)
     
3. Click on **Accept** to proceed with the **PuTTY Security Alert**

4. Next, enter teh VM username and password as below and then provide new password to which you want to change the existing password.

   * Login as: Enter `root`
   * Password: `AVSR0cks!`
   * New Password: `demo@pass123`
   * Retype New Password: `demo@pass123`

    ```
       iptables -A OUTPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
       iptables -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
    ```

6. From the **JumpBox**, from start menu search `Putty` **(1)** and then click on **Putty (2)** and open one more putty session for **TestVM-2**.

   ![](../Images/search-putty-startmenu.jpg)
   
7. Enter the Private-IP of **TestVM-2** VM in Host Name in putty tool and then click on **Open (2)**.
   * Host Name (or IP address): `10.10.4.5`
    
     ![](../Images/enter-testvm2-ip.jpg)
     
8. Click on **Accept** to proceed with the **PuTTY Security Alert**

   ![](../Images/accept-putty-aleartvm1.jpg)
   
9. Next, enter the VM username and password as below and then provide new password to which you want to change the existing password.

   * Login as: Enter `root`
   * Password: `AVSR0cks!`
   * New Password: `demo@pass123`
   * Retype New Password: `demo@pass123`
