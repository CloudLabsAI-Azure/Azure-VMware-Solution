# Exercise 2: Connect Azure VNET to AVS using Express Route Connectivity 

Azure VMware Solution offers a private cloud environment accessible from On-Premises and Azure-based resources. Services such as Azure ExpressRoute, VPN connections, or Azure Virtual WAN deliver the connectivity.

## Lab objectives

In this Exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create connection in VNet Gateway
+ Task 2: Confirm access from Jumpbox

### Task 1: Create connection in VNet Gateway

1. Once authorization key is created, the new key appears in the list of authorization keys for the private cloud. Copy the **authorization key** and **ExpressRoute ID** and keep it handy. You will need them to complete the peering. The authorization key disappears after some time, so copy it as soon as it appears.

     * Peer circuit URI (4): paste the **ExpressRoute ID** value which you noted in previous steps
     * Routing weight (5): Leave default

    Now, click on the **Review + create (6)** button to add the connection, and wait for few seconds to get the connection succeed.
