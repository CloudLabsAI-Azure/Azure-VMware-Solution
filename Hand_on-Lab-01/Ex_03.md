##  Exercise 2: Configure DHCP for Azure VMware Solution

### NSX-T on AVS
After deploying Azure VMware Solution, you can configure an NSX-T network segment from NSX-T Manager or the Azure portal. Once configured, the segments are visible in Azure VMware Solution, NSX-T Manager, and vCenter.

NSX-T comes pre-provisioned by default with an NSX-T Tier-0 gateway in Active/Active mode and a default NSX-T Tier-1 gateway in Active/Standby mode. These gateways let you connect the segments (logical switches) and provide East-West and North-South connectivity. Machines will not have IP addresses until statically or dynamically assigned from a DHCP server or DHCP relay.

## Lab objectives
In this Exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Add DHCP Profile in AVS Private Cloud
+ Task 2: Create an NSX-T T1 Logical Router
+ Task 3: Add the DHCP Profile to the T1 GatewayF
+ Task 4: Create Network Segment for AVS VM workloads

### Task 1: Add DHCP Profile in AVS Private Cloud
A DHCP profile specifies a DHCP server type and configuration. You can use the default profile or create others as needed. A DHCP profile can be used to configure DHCP servers or DHCP relay servers anywhere in your SDDC network.

|AVS NSX-T Details|	  |
|-------|-------|
|DHCP Server IP	| 10.10.5.1/30|
|Segment Name| Web-Segment|
|Segment Gateway| 10.10.4.1/2|
|DHCP Range| 10.10.4.4-10.10.4.2544|


1. On the **Azure portal**, navigate to **AVS Private cloud** and select **VMware credentials (1)** under **Manage** tab. From **NSX-T Manager credentials (2)** copy the **Username (3)**, **Password (4)** and **Web client URL (5)**.

3. On **VMware NSX-T** login page paste the **Username (1)** and **Password (2)**. Click on **LOG IN (3)**.

   ![Login](../Images/task2.3.jpg)

4. Once successfully logged in click on **POLICY** on the top right. On the **User Interface Mode Toggle** pop-up, check the **Don't show this again** box and click on **GOT IT!**.

   ![POLICY](../Images/task2.4.jpg)

5. In the **NSX-T Console**, click **Networking**. Select **DHCP** under management and click on **ADD DHCP PROFILE**.

   ![DHCP PROFILE](../Images/task2.5.jpg)

6. On the DHCP profile page provide the following details and **Save (4)**.
  
   - **Profile Name:** `Web-DHCP` **(1)**
   - **Profile Type:** `DHCP Server` **(2)**
   - **Server IP Address:** `10.10.5.1/30` **(3)**

      ![DHCP PROFILE](../Images/task2.6.jpg)

7. The **DHCP profile** has been added successfully.

## Task 2: Create an NSX-T T1 Logical Router
NSX-T has the concept of Logical Routers (LR). These Logical Routers can perform both distributed or centralized functions. In AVS, NSX-T is deployed and configured with a default T0 Logical Router and a default T1 Logical Router. The T0 LR in AVS cannot be manipulated by AVS customers, however the T1 LR can be configured however an AVS customer chooses. AVS customers also have the option to add additional T1 LRs as they see fit.

   ![NSX-T Console](../Images/logicalRouter.png)

1. In the **NSX-T Console**, click **Networking (1)**. Select **Tier-1 Gateways (2)** under connectivity, then click **ADD TIER-1 GATEWAY (3)**.

   ![NSX-T Console](../Images/add_tier-1_Gateway.png)
   
2. Enter the following detail on the create the Tier-1 Gateway
 
    - **Tier-1 Gateway Name**:  `TNTxx-T1 `.
    - **Linked Tier-0 Gateway**: Select the default T0 Gateway.   
    - **Edge Cluster**: Select the available cluster from the drop down.
    
    > **Note:** Replace the _xx_ in the **Tier-1 Gateway** name with the numbers present in your **Linked Tier-0 Gateway** name. Similar to the image shown below
   
   ![NSX-T Console](../Images/tier_gateway.1.png)

3. Next under **Route Advertisement** enable the following and click in **Save**.
    
      - All Static Routes
      - All DNS Forwarder Routes
      - All Connected Segments & Service Ports
      - All IPSec Local Endpoints
      - All NAT IP's

   ![NSX-T Console](../Images/Route_Advertisement.png)

4. Select **NO** on the **Tier-1 Gateway Lab-T1** is sucessfully created.

### Task 3: Add the DHCP Profile to the T1 Gateway

NSX-T has the concept of Logical Routers (LR). These Logical Routers can perform both distributed or centralized functions. In AVS, NSX-T is deployed and configured with a default T0 Logical Router and a default T1 Logical Router. The T0 LR in AVS cannot be manipulated by AVS customers, however the T1 LR can be configured however an AVS customer chooses. AVS customers also have the option to add additional T1 LRs as they see fit.

1. On **Tier-1 Gateways** page, click on **Set DHCP Configuration**. 

   ![Tier-1 Gateways](../Images/task2.9.jpg)

2. In **Set DHCP Configuration** pane select **Type** as **DHCP Server (1)** and **DHCP Server Profile** as **Web-DHCP (2)** then click **Save (3)**.

   ![Set DHCP Configuration](../Images/task2.10.jpg) 

3. On the  **Tier-1 Gateways** page select **Save (1)** and **CLOSE EDITING (2)**.

### Task 4: Create Network Segment for AVS VM workloads
Network segments are logical networks for use by workload VMs in the SDDC compute network. Azure VMware Solution supports three types of network segments: routed, extended, and disconnected.

   - A routed network segment (the default type) has connectivity to other logical networks in the SDDC and, through the SDDC firewall, to external networks.

   - An extended network segment extends an existing L2VPN tunnel, providing a single IP address space that spans the SDDC and an On-Premises network.

   - A disconnected network segment has no uplink and provides an isolated network accessible only to VMs connected to it. Disconnected segments are created when needed by HCX. You can also create them yourself and can convert them to other segment types.

1. In the **NSX-T Console**, click **Networking (1)**. Select **Segments** under connectivity ad click on **ADD SEGMENT**.

   ![Segments](../Images/task2.12.jpg) 

2. On the Segments page provide the following details:

   - **Segment Name:**  `Web-Segment` **(1)**
   - **Connected Gateway:**  `TNT69-T1| Tier1` **(2)**
   - **Transport Zone:** `TNT69-OVERLAY-TZ` **(3)**
   - **Subnets:** `10.10.4.1/24` **(4)**
   Select **SET DHCP CONFIG**.

   ![Segments](../Images/task2.13.jpg)

3. On **SET DHCP CONFIG** pane under **Gateway DHCP Server** ensure to add the following and click on **APPLY**: 
   
    - **DHCP Config:** `Enabled`
    - **DHCP Server Address:** `10.10.5.1/30` 
    - **DHCP Ranges:** 10.10.4.4-10.10.4.254
    - **DNS Servers:** `10.10.0.192`

       ![Segments](../Images/task2.14.jpg)   

4. Click on **Save**.

   ![Save](../Images/task2.15.jpg) 

5. Select **NO** on the **Segment Web-Segment is sucessfully created.**
