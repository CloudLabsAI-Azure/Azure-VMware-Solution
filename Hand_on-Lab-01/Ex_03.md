## Exercise 3: AVS Administration within Azure 

## Lab objectives

In this Exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Connect to Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud
+ Task 2: Connect to vCenter Server 
+ Task 3: Configure Networking in VMware vSphere
+ Task 4: Deploy Virtual Machines in AVS
+ Task 5: Connect Azure and AVS Networks
+ Task 6: Test Connectivity

### Task 1: Connect to Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud

1. In the Azure portal, navigate to your AVS resource.

2. Go to the "Private Clouds" section.

3. Select the private cloud you want to work with.

4. Click on the "Overview" tab.

5. Look for the "vCenter Server Details" section and note down the vCenter Server address, username, and password.

### Task 2: Connect to vCenter Server

1. Download and install the VMware vSphere Client on your local machine.

2. Open the vSphere Client.

3. Connect to the vCenter Server using the details from the AVS portal.

   - Note: Ensure that your machine can reach the vCenter Server over the network. Adjust firewalls if needed.

### Task 3: Configure Networking in VMware vSphere

1. In the vSphere Client, navigate to the "Networking" tab.

2. Set up networking configurations, including port groups, VLANs, and other relevant settings.

   - Consider best practices for network segmentation and security.

### Task 4: Deploy Virtual Machines in AVS

1. In the vSphere Client, navigate to the "Hosts and Clusters" view.

2. Right-click on the cluster and select "New Virtual Machine."

3. Follow the wizard to create a virtual machine, specifying details like name, guest OS, resources, and storage.

4. Install an operating system on the virtual machine.

   - You can use templates for standardization and faster VM deployment.

### Task 5: Connect Azure and AVS Networks

1. In the Azure portal, go to the "Virtual networks" section.

2. Connect your Azure Virtual Network to the AVS private cloud.

   - Configure VPN or ExpressRoute connections if required for hybrid networking.

### Task 6: Test Connectivity

1. Ensure that your virtual machines in AVS can communicate with Azure services and vice versa.

2. Test connectivity between virtual machines within AVS.

   - Use tools like `ping` and `traceroute` for network troubleshooting.
