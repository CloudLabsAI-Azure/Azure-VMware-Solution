# Task 2: Download the HCX OVA to On-Premises vCenter

## Exercise 1: Download HCX OVA for Deployment of HCX on-premises
The next step after installing HCX on your AVS Private Cloud, is to download HCX onto our On-Premises VMware environment, this will allow us to setup the connectivity to AVS and allow us to migrate. The HCX appliance is provided by VMware and has to be requested from within the AVS HCX Manager.
