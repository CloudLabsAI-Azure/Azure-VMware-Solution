## Task 4: Advanced NSX-T Features within AVS
You can find more information about NSX-T capabilities in VMware‚Äôs website under [VMware NSX-T Data Center Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/index.html).

In this Section, you will learn just a few additional NSX-T Advanced Features. You will learn how to:
  * Create NSX-T tags for VMs
  * Create NSX-T groups based on tags
  * Create Distributed Firewall Rules in NSX-T

### Exercise 1: Assign NSX-T Tags to VMs
**NSX-T Tags** help you label NSX-T Data Center objects so that you can quickly search or filter objects, troubleshoot and trace, and do other related tasks.
You can create tags using both the **NSX-T UI** available within AVS and APIs.

More information on NSX-T Tags can be found here: [VMware NSX-T Data Center Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/administration/GUID-358DF469-75C8-48C4-B0E2-279E55C7BB3E.html#:~:text=Tags%20Tags%20help%20you%20to%20label%20NSX-T%20Data,create%20tags%20using%20both%20the%20UI%20and%20APIs.).

1. Open the **NSX-T** UI page which you have already connected in Edge browser, if you have closed the page you can reopen it using `https://10.10.0.3/` in edge browser of JumpBox. 

2. Under **Inventory (2)**, click on the **Virtual Machines (3)** option; Locate your two Virtual Machines you created in the previous task **TestVM-1** and **TestVM-2**.
 
   ![](Images/nsx-t-inventory-vms.jpg)
   
3. Click the **elipsis(...) (1)** next to the **TestVM-1** VM and click **Edit (2)**.

   ![](Images/edit-testvm1.jpg)
   
4. Locate the **Tag** area under VM edit section; add a tag with name `Web` (1) and then click on **Add item(s); Web (2)**. Now, click on the **Save (3)** to make the changes.

   ![](Images/testvm1-save-tag.jpg)
   
5. Let us add the same tag for **TestVM-2**;  Click the **elipsis(...) (1)** next to the **TestVM-2** VM and click **Edit (2)**.

   ![](Images/edit-testvm2.jpg)
   
6. Locate the **Tag** area under VM edit section; add a tag with name `Web` (1) and then click on **Add item(s); Web (2)**. Now, click on the **Save (3)** to make the changes.

   ![](Images/testvm2-save-tag.jpg) 
   
You have successfully added the Tag to the Virtual Machines, now let's us create a group by Tag name.

### Exercise 2: Create NSX-T Groups

**Groups** include different objects that are added both statically and dynamically, and can be used as the source and destination of a firewall rule.

Groups can be configured to contain a combination of Virtual Machines, IP sets, MAC sets, segment ports, segments, AD user groups, and other groups. Dynamic including of groups can be based on a tag, machine name, OS name, or computer name.

You can find more information on NSX-T Groups on [VMware‚Äôs NSX-T Data Center docs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/administration/GUID-9DFF6EE2-2E00-4097-A412-B72472596E4D.html).

1. Under **Inventory (1)**, click on the **Groups (2)** option and then **ADD GROUP (3)**

   ![](Images/groups-add-group.jpg)
  
2. Provide `WebVms` (1) in group Name and then click on **Set Members (2)**.

   ![](Images/add-groups-name.jpg)
   
3. Under **Select Members | WebVms** tab, click on **+ ADD CRITERIA (2)** in Membership Criteria. Now, under **Criteria 1** select **Virtual Machines (3)** from the available options. Select **Web (4)** for Tag Equals and click on **APPLY (5)**. 

   ![](Images/add-criteria.jpg)
   
4. Once the criteria is added **Save** the group **WebVms**.

   ![](Images/save-webvms-group.jpg)
   
5. Click on **View Members** to check the members of newly created group. 

   ![](Images/webvms-view-members.jpg)
   
6. You can see the two members under **Virtual Machines** option which are **TestVM-1** and **TestVM-2** where we added the Web as tag. Now, you can **CLOSE** the tab.

### Exercise 3: Create an NSX-T Distributed Firewall Policy

**NSX-T Distributed Firewall** monitors all East-West traffic on your AVS Virtual Machines and allows you to either deny or allow traffic between these VMs even if the exist on the same NSX-T Network Segment. This is the example of your 2 VMs and we will assume they‚Äôre 2 web servers that should never have to talk to each other. More information can be found here: [Distributed Firewall](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/3.2/administration/GUID-6AB240DB-949C-4E95-A9A7-4AC6EF5E3036.html).

1. Under **Security (1)** tab, click on the **Distributed Firewall (2)** and then **+ ADD POLICY (3)**. In place of **New Policy** provide policy name as **WebSecPolicy (4)**.

   ![](Images/websecpolicy.jpg)
   
2. Click in the **ellipses (1)**, and then **Add Rule (2)** for **WebSecPolicy**.

   ![](Images/websecpolicy-addrule.jpg)
   
3. Enter the policy name as `RuleDemo` (1) and then click on **edit üñã (2)** button for Sources.

   ![](Images/websecpolicy-addrule-name.jpg)
   
4. On **Set Sources** tab, select the **checkbox ‚òë (1)** for **WebVMs** group and click on **APPLY (2)**.

   ![](Images/websecpolicy-set-sources.jpg)
   
5. Similarly add the **Destinations** to **WebVMs (3)** group and make sure entries as per screen below; now click on **PUBLISH** to pulish the newly created Distributed Firewall Rule.

   ![](Images/websecpolicy-publish.jpg)
   
6. Once you publish the Distributed Firewall Rule, it will take about 15-20 seconds to get succeed; till then it will show as **In Progress**.

   ![](Images/websecpolicy-publish-inprogress.jpg)
   
7. You will see the **Success** status once it is successfully published.

   ![](Images/websecpolicy-publish-success.jpg)
   
8. Once the rule is published, you can try to to ping the VMs from each other. Hopefully you still have the SSH sessions open to your 2 VMs you created earlier. If not, just SSH again. From one of the VMs, run a continuous ping to the other VM‚Äôs IP address like the example below.
   * Ping TestVM-2 (10.10.4.5) from TestVM-1 (10.10.4.4): `ping 10.10.4.5`
   * Ping TestVM-1 (10.10.4.4) from TestVM-2 (10.10.4.5): `ping 10.10.4.4`

    ![](Images/websecpolicy-test-allowed-pingvms.jpg)
   
9. Change the Action in your **WebSecRule** Rule **RuleDemo** action to **Reject (1)** and click **Publish (2)**. In few seconds status will be updated to **Success (3)**.

   ![](Images/websecpolicy-test-reject-pingvms.jpg)

10. Now, switch back to the SSH VMs connection and You can notice that after publishing the change to Reject on your rule, the ping now displays ‚ÄúDestination Host Prohibited‚Äù. NSX-T DFW feature is allowing the packet to get from one VM to another but it rejects it once the second VM receives the packet.

    ![](Images/websecpolicy-test-rejected.jpg)
   
11. You can also change this option to **Drop** where the packet is completely dropped by the second VM.
