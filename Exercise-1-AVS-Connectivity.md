# Exercise 1: AVS Connectivity

Azure VMware Solution offers a private cloud environment accessible from On-Premises and Azure-based resources. Services such as Azure ExpressRoute, VPN connections, or Azure Virtual WAN deliver the connectivity.

## Scenario

Customer needs to have connectivity between their workloads in AVS, existing services and workloads in Azure, and access to the internet.

## Connectivity Options for AVS

This hands-on lab will show you how to configure the Networking components of an Azure VMware Solution for:

  * This hands-on lab will show you how to configure the Networking components of an Azure VMware Solution for:
  * Peering with remote environments using Global Reach (Not Applicable).
  * AVS Interconnect Options.
  * Configuring NSX-T (check DNS and configure DHCP, Segments, and Gateway) to manage connectivity within AVS.

The lab environment has a preconfigured Azure VMware Solution environment with an Express Route circuit. A nested or embedded VMware environment is configured to simulate an On-Premises environment (PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH). Both environments are accessible through Bastions and JumpBoxes.

After this lab is complete, you will have built out this scenario below:

  1. ExpressRoute, for connectivity between Azure VMware Solution and Azure Virtual Networks.
  2. Configure NSX-T to establish connectivity within the AVS environment.
  3. Creation of Test VMs to attach to your NSX-T Network Segments.
  4. Explore some advanced NSX-T features like tagging, creation of groups, Distributed Firewall Features.
