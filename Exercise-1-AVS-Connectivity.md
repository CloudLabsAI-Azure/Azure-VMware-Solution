# Exercise 1: AVS Connectivity

Azure VMware Solution offers a private cloud environment accessible from On-Premises and Azure-based resources. Services such as Azure ExpressRoute, VPN connections, or Azure Virtual WAN deliver the connectivity.

## Scenario

Customer needs to have connectivity between their workloads in AVS, existing services and workloads in Azure, and access to the internet.

## Connectivity Options for AVS

This hands-on lab will show you how to configure the Networking components of an Azure VMware Solution for:

  * Connecting Azure VNet’s to AVS over an ExpressRoute circuit **(Preconfigured)**.
  * Peering with remote environments using Global Reach **(Not Applicable)**.
  * AVS Interconnect Options.
  * Configuring NSX-T (check DNS and configure DHCP, Segments, and Gateway) to manage connectivity within AVS.

The lab environment has a preconfigured Azure VMware Solution environment with an Express Route circuit. A nested or embedded VMware environment is configured to simulate an On-Premises environment **(PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH)**. Both environments are accessible through Bastions and JumpBoxes.

After this lab is complete, you will have built out this scenario below:

  1. ExpressRoute, for connectivity between Azure VMware Solution and Azure Virtual Networks.
  2. Configure NSX-T to establish connectivity within the AVS environment.
  3. Creation of Test VMs to attach to your NSX-T Network Segments.
  4. Explore some advanced NSX-T features like tagging, creation of groups, Distributed Firewall Features.

## Task 1: AVS Connectivity Options

### Overview

In this section you will create a connection between an existing, non-AVS, Virtual Network in Azure and the Azure VMware Solution environment. This allows the jumpbox virtual machine you created to manage key components in the VMware management plane such as vCenter, HCX, and NSX-T. You will also be able to access Virtual Machines deployed in AVS and allow those VMs to access resources deployed in the Hub or Spoke VNet’s, such as Private Endpoints and other Azure VMs or Services.

**Summary**: Generate a new Authorization Key in the AVS ExpressRoute settings, and then create a new Connection from the Virtual Network Gateway in the VNet where the JumpBox is connected to.

### Option 1: Internal ExpressRoute Setup from AVS -> VNet

 > **NOTE:** 
   * Since we already have a virtual network gateway, you’ll add a connection between it and your Azure VMware Solution private cloud.
